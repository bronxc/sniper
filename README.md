# SNIPER

This is the future home of the SNIPER system for robust API call tracing of Windows binaries using DBI or VT-based instrumentation.

SNIPER is presented in the research paper *Designing Robust API Monitoring Solutions*.

In the upcoming weeks we will pre-release its source code starting with the DBI variant. Stay tuned!
